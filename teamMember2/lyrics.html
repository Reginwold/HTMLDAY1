                I found a love for me
                Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
                Well, I found a girl,      beautiful and sweet
                Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</article>
         
            <article>  
                'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
                Not knowing what it was
                I will not give you up this time
                But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
                And in your eyes, you're holding mine</article> 

                <article>
                Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms</article> 
                
                <article>  
                Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
                When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
                But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</article> 
                <article> 
                Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
                I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
                To carry love, to carry children of our own</article> 
               
                <article>  
                Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
                Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
                When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
                I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight</article>

                We are still kids, but we're so in love
                Fighting against all odds
                I know we'll be alright this time
                Darling, just hold my hand
                Be my girl, I'll be your man
                I see my future in your eyes</p>

                Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
                Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
                I have faith in what I see
                Now I know I have met an angel in person
                And she looks perfect
                I don't deserve this
                You look perfect tonight
